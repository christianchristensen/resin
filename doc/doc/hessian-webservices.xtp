<title>Web Services - Burlap and Hessian</title>
<type>contents</type>

<description>
<p>Burlap and Hessian are simple protocols for connecting web
services.  Burlap is XML-based, and Hessian is binary.</p>

<p>Because they are small protocols, J2ME devices like cell-phones can
use them to connect to Resin servers.  Because they are powerful, they
can be used for EJB services.</p>
