 *
 * @ApplicationScoped is a Java Injection marker telling Resin to create
 * a singleton instance of TimerService in the webApp to be used by all
 * clients.
 *
 * @Initializer selects the constructor for Java Injection and tells
 * it to inject Resin's own ScheduledExecutorService, which Resin
 * automatically registers with Java Injection under the @Current binding.

 * Using Resin's ScheduledExecutorService is a good idea because it
 * uses Resin's own thread management and configuration for the applications.
