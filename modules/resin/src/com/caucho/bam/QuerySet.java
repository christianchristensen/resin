/**
 * The @QueryGet annotation marks a SimpleBamService method as handling
 * a SET RPC query.  SET calls may modify state in the service.  If you
 * just need information, use a GET call instead.  Queries
 * are matched to results using a long id, which is unique for each
 * query in the connection.  SET queries must send either a queryResult
 * or a queryError to the caller, because the client may be blocking
 * waiting for a reply.
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * @QuerySet
 * boolean querySet(long id, String to, String from, MySetQuery value)
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * A ping RPC query handler would look like:
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * @QuerySet
 * public boolean pingQuery(long id, String to, String from, PingQuery value)
 * {
 *   getBrokerStream().queryResult(id, from, to, value);
 *
 *   return true;
 * }
 * </pre></code>
